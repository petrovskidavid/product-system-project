# E-Commerce Website for an Auto Parts Store with Employee Pages

To this application locally there are two ways of doing so.

You are able to open two terminals and run the client and server side with seperate commands which are explained in their README.md files, or you can run both at the same time.

To run both the client and server side at the same time:
1. Ensure that you are in the `./` path of the project
2. In your terminal type `npm start`

This will start both the client and server in one terminal window and you will be able to view the application under: **localhost:3000**
